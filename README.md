## Project Overview 
![ontology_diagram](https://github.com/ujm-closed/server-application/blob/feat/rest/snaps/ontologyDiagram.jpg "Project architecture")


## About the Project

This project is developed in order to demostrate Semantic Web architecture by using Spring-Boot for the backend, Graph-DB to store data in the form of triples.
The chosen domain is "Tourrist Assisting Application" that contains different resource information such as `City Information`, `Hospital Information`, `Train Station`, `Bike Station` information. 

# Application overview 
 This project consist of three main applications.  
    
> ## *FRONT-APP*
>
> found in `front-app` repository 
>   
>  This application is an Angular application which is developed in order to act as an user interface. The Angular app conects the backend to the front-end. A user can access this front-end and search for information based on a city name of France. Once a city is chosen from the list, this app shows the real-time availability and static data of bike-station. The UI also shows the current train availability data along with some more static data about train and hospitals. The UI also provides information about the current weather situation of the user-selected city.


The project has been initiated with finding proper dataset from different data sources (Heterogenous data sources) and prepared proper dataset with additional effort. This data set has been initially pushed to the chosen tripple store during the boot up time of the application. 

>
>All the functionalities were developed based on asynchronous refresh method. 
>

> ## *SERVER-APPLICATION*
>
> found in `server-application` repository 
>   
>  This application is a Java Spring application. This application has different services and controllers to open different end points. After receiving request, it prepares the rdf and triggers the Graph-DB to store the triples.
>   
   

. The detail overview and the implementation of this server-application would be described in our report.


> ## *TRIPLE STORE*
>
> We are using Graph-DB to store our triples that's being generated by the server-application of the Spring Boot. We have chosen to work with the Graph-DB for several advantages over Apache Fuseski triple store. The RDF models are perpared both in real time data basis and static file basis (files can be found in resource folder of spring boot application). 
>
.  The detail overview and the implementation of this triple-store would be described in our report.





## How to get started with the Project
 
 1. To run the program Java 11 or greater version must be installed in the computer
 2. Download the Application file from Git repositories (front-app & server-application repositories need to be downloaded) (Here is the link : [click-here](https://github.com/ujm-closed))

 3. Import the project to Eclipse as Maven Project. (Here is the link : [click-here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer))
4. Update the application properties with relevant path of GraphDB endpoint for both UPDATE, and QUERY. 
 5. Run the java application
 6. Run the front-app (see below for instruction)
 7. In the User interface there are Specific buttons  which allows to see what the application is performing.

## ANGULAR SPECIFIC SUPPORT

Your are required to install NODE JS and Angular CLI in local computer to proceed with below steps. 
(How to install NODE JS : [click-here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows))
(How to install Angular CLI: [click-here](https://cli.angular.io/))

## Initiate node package
Run `npm install` in the root folder.
## Start the application
Run `ng serve` to start the application in local environment.

# Front-App For Semantic Web Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
